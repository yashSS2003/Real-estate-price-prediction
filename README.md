#  Real Estate Price Predictor – Ensemble ML Approach
Built a regression model to predict real estate prices using features like location, BHK, bathroom count, and square footage.

Predict prices using advanced machine learning and ensemble techniques.

##  Features
-  Data preprocessing and transformation
-  Feature engineering and outlier handling
-  Multiple models: Linear, SVR, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
-  Stacking Regressor combining all models
-  GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
-  Final model selection based on R² score

##  Models Used
-  Linear Regression
-  Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
-  Random Forest Regressor
-  Gradient Boosting Regressor
-  Stacking Regressor (with hyperparameter tuning)
