Built a regression model to predict real estate prices using features like location, BHK, bathroom count, and square footage.

Trained and evaluated multiple models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and SVR, analyzing R² scores for comparison.

Implemented a Stacking Regressor to combine base models and improve performance, followed by GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.

Selected the best-performing model based on test R² score and compared it with tuned stacking performance for robust model selection.
